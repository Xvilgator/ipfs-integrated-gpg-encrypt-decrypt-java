## About

This java project is built to use BouncyCastle's PGP encryption and decryption methods for securing files and uploading them to IPFS storage using java-ipfs-http-client.

## Issues and further development

1. Getting PGP encrypted files from IPFS in Java program is currently not possible. Implementation to assemble pgp file from ByteArray output of IPFS is to be added.
